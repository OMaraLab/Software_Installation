#GROMACS Patched with Plumed for use on the Bunya H100 HPUs

Installation instructions from GROMACS-2023.5 patched with Plumed-2.9.0 on Bunya with the new H100 GPUs.

Two versions are attached - a version compiled by Billy at AIBN and a version compiled by Marlies at RCC. 

You should read Billy's installation instructions first, and Marlies changed some steps when compiling for general use on Bunya.

The version compiled by Billy is marginally faster in performance than the one compiled by Marlies (about 5% speed difference), but Marlies' compilation requires less steps.
